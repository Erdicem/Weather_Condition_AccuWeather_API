### Weather Condition Using API

I used <a href="https://developer.accuweather.com/apis">AccuWeather API </a> for access information of weather codition. 
It provides us free connection and getting data from internet. Because of this request/data we can use our website project and 
we can show to people weather condition on the our website.
